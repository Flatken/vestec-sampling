## Description
Evaluation tool to enable the execution of a Python based catalyst pipeline. The tool emulates a running simulation by loading a time dpendent dataset timestep for timestep from disc and
providing these data to the paraview catalyst pipeline for execution. Furthermore, it includes own Paraview plugins with VTK filters for data sampling of the raw data. 

The tool has the following dependencies:
*  TTK (0.9.7)
*  ParaView (5.6)

These dependecies are integrated as git submodules.

The software is funded by the VESTEC EU Project (https://www.vestec-project.eu/)
